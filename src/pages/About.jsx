      <h2>About Our Project</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Policy Summarizer project. We provide a tool that helps you to quickly and easily understand complex legal and policy documents. 
        Our goal is to make information more accessible and to empower you to make informed decisions.

      <h3 style={{ marginTop: '30px' }}>Why We Made This Project</h3>
      <p>
        In today's world, we are surrounded by complex documents that can be difficult to understand. 
        From terms of service agreements to government regulations, these documents can have a significant impact on our lives. 
        However, they are often written in dense, legalistic language that is inaccessible to the average person. 
        This can make it difficult to know what you are agreeing to, or to understand your rights and responsibilities.
        We created this project to address this problem. We believe that everyone has the right to understand the documents that affect their lives. 
        That's why we've created a tool that uses the power of artificial intelligence to summarize complex documents in plain, easy-to-understand language. 
        Our goal is to empower you to make informed decisions and to level the playing field between individuals and large organizations.

      <h3 style={{ marginTop: '30px' }}>How It Helps Society</h3>
      <p>
        By making complex documents more accessible, we hope to create a more just and equitable society. 
        When people are able to understand their rights and responsibilities, they are better able to advocate for themselves and to hold organizations accountable. 
        We also believe that our tool can be a valuable resource for journalists, researchers, and activists who are working to expose wrongdoing and to promote social change. 
        By providing a tool that can quickly and easily summarize large volumes of text, we hope to make it easier for these individuals to do their important work.
